## Contacts App

This project is a Contacts Management application built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern in WPF, and it's enhanced with Rx.NET for reactive programming.

### Project Overview

- **Purpose**: The application allows users to manage their contact list, including adding, updating, deleting, and sorting contacts. It also includes features like filtering contacts based on criteria.
- **Components**:
  - **Models**: Define the data structure for contacts and manage contact-related operations.
  - **Views**: Provide the user interface for interacting with the contact list.
  - **ViewModels**: Handle the logic for user interactions and data binding between the views and models.
  - **Reactive Extensions (Rx.NET)**: Introduced to manage and observe changes in the contact list and provide a more responsive and scalable user experience.

### Why Use Rx.NET?

Rx.NET is used in this project to simplify the process of managing and reacting to changes in data streams, making the application more robust and responsive.

### 1. What is Rx.NET?

**Definition:**
- Rx.NET (Reactive Extensions for .NET) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences.
- It is part of the broader Reactive Extensions framework developed by Microsoft.

**Key Concept:**
- **Observable Sequences:** Represent streams of data that can emit values over time. These can be used to handle asynchronous operations and event-driven programming.

### 2. How is it Different from .NET?

**Traditional .NET Events:**
- Events in .NET are treated as "special" and have limitations compared to other objects and values.
- Example: You canâ€™t easily manipulate .NET events the same way you can with other data types.

**Rx.NET Advantages:**
- **Observable Sequences:** Allow you to treat events and asynchronous operations as first-class citizens.
- **Composability:** Simplifies handling complex workflows and chaining asynchronous operations.

**Example from Code:**
```csharp
private readonly BehaviorSubject<ObservableCollection<Contact>> _contactsSubject =
    new BehaviorSubject<ObservableCollection<Contact>>(new ObservableCollection<Contact>());

public IObservable<ObservableCollection<Contact>> ContactsStream => _contactsSubject.AsObservable();
```
- Here, `_contactsSubject` is a `BehaviorSubject` that allows subscribers to react to changes in the contact list.

### 3. Observable Sequences

**Definition:**
- An observable sequence represents a stream of data that can emit values over time, allowing for asynchronous and event-based programming.

**IEnumerable vs IObservable:**
- **IEnumerable:** Pull-based, where you request data when needed.
- **IObservable:** Push-based, where data is pushed to subscribers as it becomes available.

**Cold vs. Hot Observables:**
- **Cold Observables:** Emit values only when an observer subscribes.

```csharp
var coldObservable = Observable.Range(1, 3);

coldObservable.Subscribe(x => Console.WriteLine($"First subscription: {x}"));
coldObservable.Subscribe(x => Console.WriteLine($"Second subscription: {x}"));
```

- ***First Subscription***: When you first subscribe to `coldObservable`, it will output:
  ```
  First subscription: 1
  First subscription: 2
  First subscription: 3
  ```

- ***Second Subscription***: The second subscription starts from scratch, outputting:
  ```
  Second subscription: 1
  Second subscription: 2
  Second subscription: 3
  ```

- **Hot Observables:** Emit values regardless of subscriptions.

```csharp
var hotObservable = new Subject<int>();

// First subscription before emitting values
hotObservable.Subscribe(x => Console.WriteLine($"First subscription: {x}"));

// Emit a value
hotObservable.OnNext(1); // First subscription receives this

// Second subscription after the first value has already been emitted
hotObservable.Subscribe(x => Console.WriteLine($"Second subscription: {x}"));

// Emit another value
hotObservable.OnNext(2); // Both subscriptions receive this
```

### Output
- **First Subscription Output**:
  ```
  First subscription: 1
  First subscription: 2
  ```

- **Second Subscription Output**:
  ```
  Second subscription: 2
  ```

### 4. Observers

**Definition:**
- Observers subscribe to observables to receive emitted values, handle errors, and manage the completion of the sequence.

**Key Methods in `IObserver<T>`:**
- `OnNext(T value)`: Handles new values.
- `OnError(Exception error)`: Handles errors.
- `OnCompleted()`: Handles the end of the sequence.

**Example from Code:**
```csharp
private readonly Subject<Contact> _selectedContactSubject = new Subject<Contact>();

public Contact SelectedContact
{
    get => _selectedContact;
    set
    {
        this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref _selectedContact, value);
        _selectedContactSubject.OnNext(value);
    }
}
```
- Here, `_selectedContactSubject` notifies subscribers whenever `SelectedContact` changes.

### 5. Subject

**Definition:**
- A `Subject` acts as both an observable and an observer. It can receive data (like an observer) and broadcast it to subscribers (like an observable).

**Types of Subjects:**
- **Subject<T>:** Basic real-time emission.
- **BehaviorSubject<T>:** Starts with a default value and always provides the most recent value to new subscribers.
- **ReplaySubject<T>:** Replays past values to new subscribers.
- **AsyncSubject<T>:** Emits only the final value after completion.

**Example from Code:**
```csharp
private readonly BehaviorSubject<Contact> _tempContactSubject;

public UpdateContactViewModel(Contact contact, ContactList contactList)
{
    _tempContactSubject = new BehaviorSubject<Contact>(new Contact
    {
        FirstName = contact.FirstName,
        // Other properties
    });
}
```
- `_tempContactSubject` is a `BehaviorSubject` that provides the latest contact details to subscribers.

### 6. Insights

#### Filtering
**Filtering** allows you to selectively process items from an observable sequence based on specific conditions.
- **Where**: Filters items that meet a condition.
- **Take**: Captures only the first `n` items in the sequence.
- **Skip**: Ignores the first `n` items in the sequence.

#### Transformation
**Transformation** modifies the items in an observable sequence to create a new sequence with transformed data.
- **Select**: Projects each item into a new form.
- **SelectMany**: Maps each item to another sequence and flattens the results into one sequence.

#### Aggregation
**Aggregation** combines multiple items from an observable sequence into a single result.
- **Aggregate**: Reduces the sequence into a single value using a specified accumulator function.
- **Count**: Returns the number of items in the sequence.

#### Partitioning
**Partitioning** divides an observable sequence into smaller groups or segments.
- **GroupBy**: Groups items based on a specified key.
- **Buffer**: Collects items into fixed-size batches.

#### Combining Sequences
**Combining Sequences** merges or joins multiple observable sequences into one, allowing you to work with them together.
- **Merge**: Combines several sequences into a single sequence by interleaving their emissions.
- **Zip**: Combines items from multiple sequences into pairs or tuples.

### 7. Schedulers

**Definition:**
- Schedulers control the execution context of observables and observers, determining where and when work is performed.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Schedulers:** Manage the execution of tasks (e.g., on the UI thread, background thread).

### 8. ReactiveCommand

**Definition:**
- A `ReactiveCommand` is a command that is tied to an observable sequence, allowing you to create commands that can be executed based on certain conditions or events.

**Usage:**
- `ReactiveCommand` simplifies command management in MVVM, especially when dealing with asynchronous tasks or complex workflows.

**Example:**
```csharp
public ReactiveCommand<Unit, Unit> AddContactCommand { get; }

public MainViewModel()
{
    AddContactCommand = ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask(async () =>
    {
        // Code to add a contact
        await AddContactAsync();
    });

    AddContactCommand.ThrownExceptions
        .Subscribe(ex => Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}"));
}
```
- Here, `AddContactCommand` is a `ReactiveCommand` that triggers the `AddContactAsync` method. It also handles any exceptions thrown during execution and logs them.

### 9. Use Cases

**Common Applications:**
- **User Interface (UI) Events:** Handling streams of UI events like button clicks.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Applications like stock tickers and chat systems.
- **Async Programming:** Simplifies handling asynchronous tasks and operations.

**Example from Code:**
```csharp
public void LoadFromFile()
{
    if (File.Exists(FilePath))
    {
        var json = File.ReadAllText(FilePath);
        var contacts = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ObservableCollection<Contact>>(json);
        if (contacts != null)
        {
            Contacts.Clear();
            foreach (var contact in contacts)
            {
                Contacts.Add(contact);
            }
        }
        _contactsSubject.OnNext(new ObservableCollection<Contact>(Contacts));
    }
}
```
- This code uses Rx.NET to notify observers whenever the contact list is updated.
